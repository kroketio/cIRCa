# Design, motivations, goals

chatripper is a chat platform built on top of IRC. It enhances the 
protocol by introducing modern features that bring it in line with 
todayâ€™s chat expectations, while remaining fully compatible with 
IRC and IRCv3 clients.

While many existing, centralized chat services provide a modern chat experience, 
self-hosted alternatives like XMPP, Matrix, and others fail to replicate a similar user 
experience effectively.

## Goals

- Multiple connections to a single account
- 'Always online' (bouncer-like functionality)
- Message history
- Advanced role system
  - Roles that define permissions (e.g., moderators can ban but not delete messages)  
  - Per-channel and per-category overrides  
  - Restrict channel visibility to specific roles (e.g., `#mod-chat`, `#admin-chat`)
- Full-text message search
- Message editing
- File transfers that just work
- audio/video calls
- Embedded links
- Server side Python scripting to add or modify behavior
- Avatars, display names, metadata
- Invite links
- Simple protocol
- Built-in webserver, with a web chat client

## Why we choose IRC

Because it is simple, we can quickly debug things using network capture
tools (shoutout to `ngrep -dlo -qt -W byline port 6667`), and the protocol 
is well understood. Other protocols are more complicated, requiring 
more implementation effort. 

IRCv3 is a move in the right direction, but not quite (see [Mastodon thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20230418155309mp_/https://social.treehouse.systems/@ariadne/110199104168870444)). 
However, the good news is that IRC's simplicity negates the fact that 
this protocol was not designed for our goals outlined above. We can 
simply add protocol features (specifications) as we go, in a timely manner.

## Our strategy

We have adopted the following strategy:

1. Do not be 100% IRC spec compliant - but compliant enough for existing clients to work
2. Do not implement all specifications, only if it helps reach our goals
3. When a feature cannot be implemented using an existing specification, we introduce a new specification
4. Try to encapsulate everything over the IRC connection - only go out-of-band when all options are exhausted 
5. Make our own chat client, eventually

## Target audience

#### Users

chatripper aims to be usable for regular, casual internet users. We believe many 
self-hosted chat platforms, and protocols are practically 
only usable for computer-literate people. chatripper will be different - it 
will be for everyone.

#### Operations

We aim to provide a headache-free hosting experience. You turn it on, and It Just Works.

We will provide a Docker compose that will:

1. Run chatripper
2. Not require you to set up TLS certificates, or DNS records
3. Not require you to mess around in +1000 line YAML files (or other types of config files)

All configuration will be done via an admin interface.
