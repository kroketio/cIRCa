# cIRCa

cIRCA is a modern approach to IRC, reimagining the protocol, server architecture, and client features
from the ground up. Our focus is **solving real-world challenges**, while remaining compatible
with existing clients.

**Work in progress**

## Design philosophy

* A strong focus on utility, practicality, and serviceability
* Embrace modern chat features like accounts, history, metadata, previews, video/audio calls
* High customizability via an admin web-interface (no messing around in config files)
* Server-side scripting with Python
* Integrated web chat client
* REST API

## Performance

cIRCa is designed to operate primarily in memory. It is both multithreaded and 
asynchronous, and while we havenâ€™t tested it, we are confident it can handle thousands 
of concurrent connections.

We regularly benchmark key parts of the code to ensure optimal performance. I/O operations are 
queued whenever possible, and concurrency is prioritized to deliver a fast, responsive chat 
experience - low-powered hardware included.

## Server-side scripting

Change messages in transit, modify/add IRCv3 message tags, and more.

```python3
class MyModule(QIRCModule):
  def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()

  @qirc.on(QIRCEvent.CHANNEL_MSG)
  def channel_message_handler(self, channel: Channel, acc: Account, msg: Message) -> Message:
    if acc.username == "sander":
      # messages from `sander` are always uppercase now
      msg.text = msg.text.upper()

    # all channel messages get this tag attached
    msg.tags["example-tag"] = "example-value"
    return msg
```

`Channel` and `Account` objects are available for any additional logic.

> &lt;user1&gt; What problem does this solve? 

> &lt;user2&gt; Lua would be a better choice for a scripting engine than Python

> &lt;user3&gt; you can finish the IRC server in Hell with all the other C++ programmers  
> &lt;user3&gt; and Python programmers  
> &lt;user3&gt; us Perl/Go programmers are going to heaven

> &lt;user4&gt; What is your elevator pitch?
 
> &lt;user5&gt; Qt is bloated  
> &lt;user5&gt; what if I want to run this on ARM?

> &lt;user6&gt; to be honest I'm not sure if individual message signatures are of much use really
